# Modelling the fire regime of the Quebec province

The study area in Quebec province rougthly covers the productive forests of the province. It's currently divied in 4 homogeneous fire regime zones of size:    
```{r frz, echo=F}
zones <- raster("C:/WORK/QBCMOD/QbcLDM/inputlyrs/asc/FRZone.asc")
plot(zones, main ="Fire Regime Zones", col=viridis(4))
dta <- data.frame(table(zones[]))
names(dta) <- c("zone", "ha")
kable(dta)
```

Per each fire regime zone and time step, QbcLDM drawns the number of fires to be burnt from a upper truncated Poission distribution with lambda:  
```{r nf, echo=F}
nf <- read.table("C:/WORK/QBCMOD/QbcLDM/inputfiles/NumFires.txt", header = T)
kable(nf)
```

The density functions of these Poisson distributions are:  
```{r poisson, echo=F}
x <- seq(0, 10, 1)
lambda <- c(2.6, 2.7, 2.9, 1)
colors <- viridis(4) 
labels <- paste0("Z", LETTERS[1:4])
i <- 4
plot(x, dpois(x,lambda[i]), type="l", lty=2, lwd=2, xlab="x value", col=colors[i],
      ylab="Density", main="Comparison of Poisson Distributions")
for (i in 1:3){
  lines(x, dpois(x,lambda[i]), lty=2, lwd=2, col=colors[i])
}
legend("topright", inset=.05, title="Distributions",
       labels, lwd=2, lty=c(1, 1, 1, 1), col=colors)
```
  
The distributions themselves do not change over time, even if the number of fires can be increased at the rate of `fire.rate.increase`.

Per each fire regime zone and time step, the target size of each fire is drawn from a discret distribution (lower and upper limits in km^2^):  
```{r fs, echo=F}
fsize <- read.table("C:/WORK/QBCMOD/QbcLDM/inputfiles/FireSizesEmpiric.txt", header = T)
kable(fsize)
fsizes <- select(fsize, -lower) %>% gather(zone, p, -upper)
ggplot(data=fsizes, aes(x=upper, y=p, fill=zone)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position=position_dodge()) +   theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#440154FF", "#31688EFF", "#35B779FF", "#FDE725FF", "white")) +
  ggtitle("Probability of fire size per zone")
```

Reading code's model, Mathieu suggests that forest composition (then fuels) modify both, the number of fires per time step and the size of the fires. He calculates the baseline fuel load per fire regime zone at the begging of the simulation, then compares this baseline with the current fuel load (at each time step) to derive a modifed fuel load that will ultimately modify both fire regime indicators. 
Considering the following fuel type modifiers:    
   

Type      SppGrp                              Modif
--------  ----------------------------------  ----------------
1         "BOJ",  "ERS", "NonFor", "other"    0.1
2         "PET", ("EPN", "SAB", Age<=40)      0.4
3         "EPN", "SAB" Age<=40                0.95 
--------  ----------------------------------  ----------------

The current baseline fuel load, the fuel load at the end of the period, and the modifying factor (when only simulating wildfires, post-fire regeneration and natural sucession) are respectively:
```{r baseline, echo=F}
load(file="C:/WORK/QBCMOD/QbcLDM/inputlyrs/rdata/land.rdata")
source("C:/WORK/QBCMOD/QbcLDM/mdl/fuel.type.r")  
fuel.types.modif <- data.frame(type=1:3, baseline=c(0.1, 0.4, 0.95)) 
baseline.fuel <- group_by(fuel.type(land, fuel.types.modif), zone) %>% summarize(x=round(mean(baseline),3))
kable(baseline.fuel)
current.fuels <- read.table("C:/WORK/QBCMOD/QbcLDM/outputs/Test01/FuelLand.txt", header=T) %>%
             filter(year==2095) %>% select(-run)
kable(current.fuels)
modif.fuels <- current.fuels
modif.fuels$x <- round(1+(current.fuels$x-baseline.fuel$x)/baseline.fuel$x,3)
kable(modif.fuels)

```

### Questions, Doubts, Ideas 

1. How are the homogeneous fire regime zones defined? Which are the base variables used to classify the study area in these four fire regime zones? Maybe this information is specified in the first paper.    
   
2. Will be essential that these fire regime zones become dynamic in a context of global change?    
  
3. I don't think that number of fires nor fire sizes have to be modified by fuel types (even if as currently implemented, fuels spatial distribution barely modify fire regime). In my oppinion, fuels should only influence the process of fire sperading and thus spread rate and probability of burn. **TO BE DISCUSSED**. 
   
4. Which is the fire database used to fit the Poisson distributions Number of fires per fire step?  
I looked for data in the *Canadian National Fire Database*, [CNFDB](https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/ha/nfdb) (Fig. 1).  
I overlapped fire peimeters with fire regime zones and retrieve the mean number of fires per zone every year and every 5-year period. I tryeid to fit these empirical distributions to theoretical Poisson distributions but I didn't get successful results.    
Wrongly (I think), in the last model's version, the number of fires was calculated as follows:  
`num.fires <- nf.dist$lambda[nf.dist$zone==zone] * fire.step * (1+(t*fire.rate.increase))`  
This means, that at the end of the period, the number of fires in zone A (assuming `fire.rate.increase=0`) is always `r 2.6*(2095-2010)`.  
**TO BE IMPROVED**   
The question is then:  
*How climate change and landscape forest composition influences fire regime and how we can model it?*

5. Fire ignitions locations of fire of size greater than 200 ha is also available at [CNFDB](https://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/ha/nfdb) (Fig. 2). The cause of fires is reported (e.g. U - unknown, L - lightning, H - human, H.PB - prescribed burn, and Re - reburn). In Fig. 2, red points are human caused fires, grey points are lightnings and black points are ignitions of unknown causes. This information can be useful to initalize a probability ignition layer or even better, find a relationship between fire ignitions and landscape composition / weather. The relationship could be then included in the model so probabaility of fire ignition is dynamically updated at every time step. **TO BE EXPLORED**.

6. One of the products of the MFFP project is to have a zonation for fires.Am I right? Is this already available? Which will be the source information and variables to produce such cartography? Could it be useful to spatialize fire regime modelling in our framework? **TO BE CLARIFIED**.

# Modelling fire events

Per each fire regime zone, once the number of fires is fixed, the algorithm of fire spreading and burning for each fire event is as follows:  

1. Determine target area (in km^2^) and convert to target size (in pixels).  
2. Select a fire wind direction `fire.wind` according to S - 10%, SW - 30%, W - 60.  
3. Pick up an ignition location according to the ignition probability. This location starts the fire front. Track this location as both, burnt cell and visited cell.    
4. While the number of burnt cells < target size, fire front will spread to the neighbours and burn some of these cells.  
    * Find the 4 closest neighbours of all cells in the fire front. Keep only those belonging to the study area and have not been visited yet.  
    * For these neighbouring cells compute `sr = wflam * fuel + wwind * (neigh.dir-fire.wind)` where `wflam` and `wwind` are weigthing factors summing up 1, `fuel` is the fuel modifying factor, and `neigh.dir` is the direction from source to sink locations.  Then, compute `pb=1+rpb*log(sr)` where `rpb` is a parameter controlling the range of burning probabilities (and also the formation of fire islands).  
    *  Randomly burnt cells according to `pb` but always burn those cells when `pb>=pb.upper.th` and never burn those cells when `pb<pb.lower.th`. Increase accordingly the number of burnt cells.  
    * Record all burnt and unburnt neighbours as visit cells.  
    * The fire front is formed now by the recently burnt cells.     
     
I've detected that sometimes fires (often big ones) stop before reaching target area. I've introduced in the algorithm a condition to let's say "reuse" a target size if it is bigger than 200 km^2^ and 50% has not been burnt. By reusing it, I mean the model starts a new fire event with burn this same target size.  

### Fire wind

Consult the Climate Normals of Canada:  
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/weathercan/vignettes/glossary_normals.html

Find out 11 stations with montly and annualy wind direction informed.  

Retrieve the % of annual wind direction.  

**TO BE DONE**: Do a tesselation of the study area based on these 11 meteorological stations, or a buffer around them to make main wind direction spatially explicit.
